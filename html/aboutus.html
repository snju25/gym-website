                    <h3>Owner & Boxing Coach</h3><br>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing.
                        I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my
                        knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump
                        into the ring as your sparring partner.
                        For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene.
                        He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his
                        knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with
                        passion and enthusiasm.

                        The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised.

                        Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you
                        will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best cardiovascular
                        workouts available.
                    </p>
